# GymRat
This is the COSC 412 - Software Engineering Mobile Application Project entitled GymRat

Front End 
In the frontend we used Android Studio. Android studio is a free software, and can be downloaded directly from the Android Studio Developers webpage. 
When you navigate to the website, select the version download you wish to install (OS, Size, etc). Follow the prompts for the appropriate download 
Now it's time to pull our repository from git. Navigate to our repository and then select fork. Forking the repository will allow it to show up in your account, and you will be able to make and publish edits as you wish. 
Click on the green code button to Download the source code folder to your local computer


Our group heavily used the Github desktop to easily pull,push and merge onto our git repository.
Navigate to the GitHub Desktop, and follow the instructions for proper download. 






Now it's time to pull the repository. Open up GitHub Desktop, and select: 
File -> New Repository
Enter in the path to where the source code was downloaded.



Once you make changes, commit and push to github. 
If working on a separate branch, you will have to do a pull request to merge to master. 


[To Commit Changes]
Once your edits are made, save the files. 
Then navigate to the GitHub Desktop, and you should see a list of the changes you made on the right hand side of the screen. 
Ensure you are working on the proper branch by looking at the top of the screen. 
In the bottom left corner there is a text box for Summary and Description. 
Here you can list a short title, and summary of the edits you made. 


[To Pull Changes]
Open  up the GitHub Desktop, and select the branch you want to pull from. 
Then select “Pull Origin”
